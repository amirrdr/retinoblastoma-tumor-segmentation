# Code for the Paper "Semi-supervised segmentation of retinoblastoma tumors in fundus images"
Retinoblastoma is a rare form of cancer that predominantly affects young children as the primary intraocular malignancy. Studies conducted in developed and some developing countries have revealed that early detection can successfully cure over 90% of children with retinoblastoma. An unusual white reflection in the pupil is the most common presenting symptom. Depending on the tumor size, shape, and location, medical experts may opt for different approaches and treatments, with the results varying significantly due to the high reliance on prior knowledge and experience. This study aims to present a model based on semi-supervised machine learning that will yield segmentation results comparable to those achieved by medical experts. First, the Gaussian mixture model is utilized to detect abnormalities in approximately 4200 fundus images. Due to the high computational cost of this process, the results of this approach are then used to train a cost-effective model for the same purpose. The proposed model demonstrated promising results in extracting highly detailed boundaries in fundus images. Using the Sørensen–Dice coefficient as the comparison metric for segmentation tasks, an average accuracy of 93% on evaluation data was achieved.
